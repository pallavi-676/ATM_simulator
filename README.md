# 🏧 ATM Simulator (Python)

A simple ATM Simulator built using basic Python.
This project allows a user to create an account by setting a PIN and initial balance,
then perform basic banking operations like checking balance, withdrawing money,
and depositing money.

This program is user-input based and does not store any data permanently.

---

## 📌 Features

- Set PIN and initial balance at runtime
- Secure PIN-based login
- Check account balance
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Deposit money
- Menu-driven interface
- Beginner-friendly Python logic

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Basic concepts:
  - Variables
  - Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
  - Loops (while)
  - User input/output

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Clone this repository or download the file
3. Open terminal / command prompt
4. Run the program using:

```bash
python atm_simulator.py



🧪 Sample Workflow
User sets a 4-digit PIN

User enters initial deposit amount

User logs in using the same PIN

User chooses from the menu:

Check Balance

Withdraw Money

Deposit Money

Exit

Program ends when the user selects Exit

⚠️ Important Notes
All data is temporary and is lost once the program stops

No database or file storage is used

This project is designed for learning and academic purposes

🎯 Learning Outcome
Understanding how ATM systems work logically

Practicing control flow and loops in Python

Handling user input securely

Building a menu-driven console application

📚 Future Improvements
